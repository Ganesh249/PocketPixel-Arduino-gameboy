## Hardware Components

| Component        | Description                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Arduino Nano     | Microcontroller                   |
| OLED Display     | 128x64 I2C (SSD1306)              |
| Push Buttons     | 7 buttons for input
| Buzzer           | For sound effects (optional)      |
| 0.1uf capacitor  | For button debouncing (if needed) |

##  Games Overview

### Dino Run
- Jump over cacti using the UP button.
- Cacti spawn at fixed distances (90â€“200 px).
- Score increases with time.
- Game over when dino hits a cactus.
- High score stored in EEPROM.

### Flappy Bird
- Tap UP to flap.
- Avoid pipes coming from the right.
- Smooth gravity and collision system.
- Game restarts on crash.

### Star Wars Shooter
- Control your ship using the UP and DOWN keys.
- Shoot the planet while dodging asteroids.
- Asteroids spawn from the planet and move toward the ship.
- Bullets can destroy the planet and increase the score.
- The ship has 5 lives. When asteroids hit, the ship's lives decrease.
- The game ends when you have 0 lives.
  
### Asteroid Shooter
  - Control the Shooter using the left and right keys.
  - Shoot the asteroids falling from the TOP.
  - When a bullet hits the asteroid, the score increases.
  - When an asteroid is left unshot, the score is decreased.

## Menu System
A clean UI to navigate through the available games. The currently selected item is highlighted with a selection box.

## ðŸ› Software & Libraries

- [U8glib](https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib) â€“ OLED graphics library
- EEPROM â€“ For high score storage
- `tone()` â€“ Arduino sound function for buzzers

## How it Works

- On startup, a Custom splash screen is shown with Startup Tone.
- The main menu appears to select a game.
- Use the UP and DOWN buttons to navigate and OK to select.
- In each game, button input is polled and rendered per frame.
- Game logic and collisions are handled in individual Game functions.
- After the game is over, return to the menu or restart the game.

## Future Improvements

- Add more games
- Save multiple high scores per game
- Add animations/transitions between screens
- Low power sleep mode

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

Inspired by the original Game Boy and Arduboy, this project merges nostalgia with embedded development.


Built with love, logic, and a lot of debugging.
